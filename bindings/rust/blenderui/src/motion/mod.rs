//! Animation: GSAP and Motion (Framer Motion) on one engine (`kit/intern/anim`,
//! feature `anim`).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! rsx! {
//!     <motion.div
//!         initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
//!         animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
//!         whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
//!         whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
//!         transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 20 }}
//!     >
//!         "Hello"
//!     </motion.div>
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Every ease of GSAP, Motion, CSS and Blender is there by name; springs and
//! inertia are solved in closed form. Objects of literals (`vars!{}`, rsx's
//! `{{ }}`) are `static`s: their property ids and eases are resolved once per
//! call site, and a frame of moving values (a redraw) allocates nothing and
//! walks only the animated elements and what is under them.
