# Packaging and publishing (`blenderui` on PyPI)

| | |
|---|---|
| PyPI name | **`blenderui`** (`pip install blenderui`) |
| Import names | `blenderui` (recommended) and `bui` (the same modules), plus the extension `buipy` |
| Build backend | [scikit-build-core](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io) driving the project's CMake (`pyproject.toml`) |
| Version | `bindings/python/bui/_version.py`, the single source (CMake reads it too) |
| Python | 3.11+ (CPython) |
| Console script | `blenderui-tk app.py`, which is the same as `python -m bui.tksyntax app.py` |

> The import name `bui` is kept for existing code. An unrelated project owns
> `bui` on PyPI, so published code should use `import blenderui`. The two
> can't both be installed under the same import name.

## What a wheel contains

```
site-packages/
  buipy.<abi>.pyd|.so     the C kit + raster engine (one extension module)
  bui/                     tksyntax/, qtsyntax.py, components/, host.py ...
  blenderui/               alias package: blenderui.X is bui.X
  blenderui-<v>.dist-info/
```

On Windows the extension is built with MinGW-w64 GCC (UCRT) and statically
linked against the GCC runtime. It depends only on system DLLs and
`python3xx.dll`. A wheel is about 0.4 MB compressed; the sdist is about
1.7 MB (it excludes `reference/` and build trees).

## Build locally

```sh
python -m pip install build
python -m build                    # sdist + wheel in dist/

# Windows with MSYS2 MinGW (the tested toolchain):
set CMAKE_GENERATOR=MinGW Makefiles
set CC=gcc
set CXX=g++
python -m build
```

Test the wheel in a clean environment:

```sh
python -m venv /tmp/bui-venv
/tmp/bui-venv/bin/pip install dist/blenderui-*.whl
/tmp/bui-venv/bin/python -c "import blenderui, blenderui.tksyntax, blenderui.components; print(blenderui.__version__)"
```

The test suites (`bindings/python/tests/`) pass against an installed wheel.
Remove the source tree from `sys.path` and keep `examples/` on it for
`test_components`.

## CI (`.github/workflows/wheels.yml`)

| Job | Does |
|---|---|
| `wheels` | `cibuildwheel` for Linux (manylinux x86_64), Windows (MinGW, x86_64) and macOS (arm64 + x86_64), CPython 3.11–3.14; each wheel is imported as a smoke test |
| `sdist` | `python -m build --sdist` |
| `tests` | CMake build + `ctest` (all C and Python suites) on Windows |
| `publish` | On a `v*` tag: upload everything to PyPI with trusted publishing. Manual run with `testpypi`: upload to TestPyPI. |

## One-time PyPI setup

1. Create the `blenderui` project on PyPI. Register it as a
   [pending trusted publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/)
   with this repository, workflow `wheels.yml`, environment `pypi`.
2. Do the same on TestPyPI with environment `testpypi`.
3. In the GitHub repository settings, create the environments `pypi` and
   `testpypi` (optionally with required reviewers).

`pyproject.toml` `[project.urls]` already points at
`github.com/ppmpreetham/BUI`.

No API tokens are stored anywhere.

## Releasing everything at once

One command does the whole release:

```sh
python tools/release.py minor              # or patch, major, X.Y.Z; add --npm patch for the npm packages
```

It checks you are on a clean, up-to-date `main`, bumps every version and pushes that commit, waits
for the `ci` and `wheels` workflows to go green on it, tags and pushes the tag, waits for the
publish, then checks crates.io, npm and PyPI for the new version. It never tags a red commit.
`--dry-run` shows the plan; if a publish step fails, fix it, use "Re-run failed jobs" on the run
(no new tag needed) and run `python tools/release.py --resume`, which only waits and checks.
GitHub's anonymous API allows 60 requests an hour (enough for one release); set `GITHUB_TOKEN`
for more.

The two steps it runs, if you want them by hand: `tools/bump_version.py` changes every version in one go
(the Python package, the Rust workspace and the sibling dependency versions of every crate, the
changelog, the lock files, and with `--npm` the npm packages) and runs
`tools/check_versions.py` on the result:

```sh
python tools/bump_version.py minor --commit --push   # 0.2.0 -> 0.3.0, commits only those files, pushes main
# ... wait for CI to go green on that commit ...
python tools/bump_version.py --tag --push            # tags v0.3.0 and pushes the tag: the release starts
```

`minor` can be `major`, `patch` or an exact `X.Y.Z`; add `--npm patch` to move the npm
packages too (they are versioned on their own), and `--dry-run` to see what would change. The
tag step refuses a tag that already exists and a branch that isn't pushed yet. Doing it by hand
is the same thing: `git tag v0.3.0 && git push origin v0.3.0`.

| Workflow | Publishes |
|---|---|
| `wheels.yml` | the Python wheels and sdist to PyPI (trusted publishing, no secret) |
| `release.yml` | the Rust crates to crates.io, `@blender-ui/native` and `@blender-ui/react` to npm, and a GitHub Release |

`release.yml` first checks that the tag matches the Python and Rust versions
(`python tools/check_versions.py v0.2.0` runs the same check by hand), then runs the whole
`ci.yml` suite on every platform, then publishes. A version that is already on a registry is
skipped (crates.io, npm and PyPI alike: `wheels.yml` builds nothing when PyPI already has the
version), so only what is missing runs: a run that failed halfway (say, crates.io timing out on the big
`blenderui-sys` upload) can simply be re-run. The npm packages are versioned on their own; bump
them in their `package.json` when they change.

One-time setup:

- **crates.io:** a repository secret `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` (Settings > Secrets and variables >
  Actions): a crates.io API token with the scopes `publish-new` and `publish-update`.
- **npm:** no secret. On npmjs.com, open each of `@blender-ui/native` and `@blender-ui/react`
  > Settings > Trusted Publisher > GitHub Actions, and enter the owner `ppmpreetham`, the
  repository `BUI` and the workflow filename `release.yml` (leave the environment empty).
  The workflow publishes with OIDC and npm adds provenance by itself.
- **A new npm package** (a new framework binding, such as `@blender-ui/svelte`) can't have a trusted
  publisher before it exists, and a first `npm publish` from CI has no permission yet (the 404
  "could not be found or you do not have permission"). Publish it once by hand, after
  `@blender-ui/native` is out (it depends on it): `cd bindings/svelte && npm publish --access public`,
  logged in as a member of the `@blender-ui` organization. Then add the trusted publisher (the same
  form as above). Until then `release.yml` skips it with a warning and `tools/release.py` shows it
  as MANUAL, not as a failure.
- **PyPI:** no secret, see above.

Try it without publishing: Actions > release > Run workflow, enter the tag and leave
"publish" unticked. That runs the checks and the CI suite, then `cargo publish --dry-run` and
`npm publish --dry-run`.

## Release checklist

1. Bump `bindings/python/bui/_version.py` (semantic versioning).
2. Add the release to `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. `ctest --test-dir build` passes locally. Optionally run the workflow by
   hand with `testpypi` and `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple blenderui`.
4. `git tag v0.2.0 && git push --tags`. CI builds, tests and publishes (see above).

## Known gaps before 1.0

- Linux wheels get the native X11 window host: `[tool.cibuildwheel.linux]
  before-all` installs the X11 headers (`libX11-devel` / `libx11-dev`), and
  libX11 itself is loaded at run time, so the wheels still import on servers
  without it. (This used to be a gap; it's fixed.)
- macOS: the native Cocoa window host is new and has been tried by hand on two
  Apple Silicon Macs so far. With `BUI_HOST=tk` the wheels use the stdlib Tk window instead, which
  needs `tkinter` (for example from python.org or `brew install python-tk`).
- MSVC builds work (the Rust crate and the CMake build use Visual Studio's
  toolchain), but the published Windows wheels are built with MinGW.
- No `musllinux` or 32-bit wheels yet (skipped in `[tool.cibuildwheel]`).
- The README's images use absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs, so
  PyPI shows them.

# Publishing the Rust crates (crates.io)

`blenderui` is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/blenderui)
(`cargo add blenderui`). The workspace in `bindings/rust/` has eight crates;
all but the three JavaScript crates are published to crates.io, in
dependency order (a `v*` tag does it, see above), and those three stay in the
repository:

| Crate | What it is | Depends on | crates.io |
|---|---|---|---|
| `blenderui-tailwind` | Tailwind v4 class compiler (std only) | none | Published |
| `blenderui-macros` | `rsx!` / `view!`, `#[component]`, `css!`, `tw!` | `blenderui-tailwind` | Published |
| `blenderui-sys` | FFI over the C kit; builds it with CMake | none (`cmake` at build time) | Published |
| `blenderui-paint` | shared painting types: geometry, colors, `PaintSink`, the text cache | none | Published |
| `blenderui-table` | the data table's core | `blenderui-paint` | Published |
| `blenderui-vlist` | the variable-height list's core | `blenderui-paint` | Published |
| `blenderui` | the framework | the five above | Published |
| `blenderui-imgui` | Dear ImGui on BUI (`blender-widgets` feature for Blender's widgets) | `blenderui-sys` (`imgui` feature) | Published |
| `blenderui-jsview` | The JavaScript view of a window, shared by the Node.js addon and the QuickJS runtime | `blenderui` | `publish = false` |
| `blenderui-node` | The napi-rs addon behind `@blender-ui/native` | `blenderui`, `blenderui-jsview` | `publish = false` (ships on npm) |
| `blenderui-qjs` | `bui-runtime`: BUI with embedded QuickJS, for `bui build` | `blenderui`, `blenderui-jsview` | `publish = false` (ships on npm) |

`blenderui-sys` must carry the C sources, because a published crate can't
reach `../../..`. Vendor them first. They're git-ignored and listed in the
crate's `include`:

```sh
python bindings/rust/scripts/vendor_c.py          # copies ~7 MB into blenderui-sys/csrc/
cd bindings/rust
cargo package --workspace --allow-dirty           # builds each packaged crate in isolation
```

`build.rs` looks for the C sources in three places, in order:
1. `BUI_SOURCE_DIR`, if set;
2. the surrounding repository;
3. `csrc/`, the vendored copy (what a downloaded crate has).

## Release

1. Bump `version` in `bindings/rust/Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.package]`). The
   crates share one version. Then update the `version = "..."` of the path
   dependencies in `blenderui/Cargo.toml`, `blenderui-macros/Cargo.toml` and
   `blenderui-imgui/Cargo.toml`.
2. `cargo login` once with a crates.io API token.
3. Vendor, then publish in order. `cargo publish --workspace` does the
   ordering itself on Cargo 1.90+:

```sh
python bindings/rust/scripts/vendor_c.py
cd bindings/rust
cargo publish --workspace --allow-dirty   # or, one by one:
# cargo publish -p blenderui-tailwind
# cargo publish -p blenderui-macros
# cargo publish -p blenderui-sys --allow-dirty
# cargo publish -p blenderui
```

`cargo publish --workspace` skips the `publish = false` crates. To publish
`blenderui-imgui` too (once it's ready), run `cargo publish -p blenderui-imgui`
after `blenderui-sys`.

`--allow-dirty` is needed because `csrc/` is untracked. Users need CMake and
a C compiler (MSVC, MinGW, gcc or clang) to build `blenderui-sys`.
`bench/` is excluded from the workspace and is never published.
